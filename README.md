## Description
TEXTpY_Dungeon is a text-based rogue-like game that offers endless hours of pain and death. As part of my final project for CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python, I have meticulously designed this game to provide an immersive and deadly experience for players.

## Game Mechanics
The game mechanics of TEXTpY_Dungeon are as follows:

- Execute the program using the command `python project.py`.
- Input your desired username when prompted.
- Your character will have randomly generated stats every game.
- You will see a map that consists of a series of characters:
  - **x**: Player
  - **?**: Random event; a place where you can gain a reward or suffer a penalty
  - **+**: Campfire; the final stop before the boss
  - **!**: Normal enemies
  - **\***: Elite enemies
  - **#**: Boss
- Select a valid way to move on the map.
- Whenever you encounter an event, follow the prompts accordingly.
- After several attempts, you will understand the logic behind the game and face more satisfying challenges. Have fun playing or should I say dying!
